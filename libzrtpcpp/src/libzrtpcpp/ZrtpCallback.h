/**
 * This class defines the callback functions required by ZRTP.

 * This class is a pure abstract class, aka Interface in Java, that specifies

 * uses these functions to communicate with the host environment, for example
 * to send data via the RTP/SRTP stack, to set timers and cancel timer and so
 * on.

 *
 * This ZRTP needs only ten callback methods to be implemented by the host
 * environment.

/**
 * This enum defines the information message severity.

 * problems. The severity levels and their meaning are:
 *
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Info</dt> <dd>keeps the user informed about ongoing processing and
 *     security setup.
 * </dd>
 * <dt>Warning</dt> <dd>is an information about some security issues, e.g. if
 *     an AES 256 encryption is request but only DH 3072 as public key scheme
 *     is supported. ZRTP will establish a secure session (SRTP).
 * </dd>
 * <dt>Error</dt> <dd>is used if an error occured during ZRTP protocol usage. For
 *     example if an unknown or unsupported alogrithm is offerd. In case of
 *     <em>Error</em> ZRTP will <b>not</b> establish a secure session.
 * </dd>
 * <dt>Alert</dt> <dd>shows a real security problem. This probably falls into
 *     a <em>MitM</em> category. ZRTP of course will <b>not</b> establish a
 *     secure session.
