Generate a self-signed certificate to use as certificate authority (CA)
=======================================================================


First you need to generate a key for that certificate:

$ openssl genrsa -out ca_key.pem 1024

This creates a rsa private key of length 1024 bits in ca_key.pem.

After that you need to generate the self-signed certificate, which
will contain the public key associated with this private key.

$ openssl req -x509 -new -key ca_key.pem -days 365 -out ca_cert.pem

You will be asked to enter some information about the certificate subject.
    -x509 tells openssl to generate a self-signed certificate (instead of
          a certificate signing request)
    -key  specifies which private key to use
    -days specifies how many days the certificate will be valid
    -out  specifies in which file to save the certificate



Generate a user certificate signed by this certificate authority
================================================================

Similarly you first need to generate a private key:

$ openssl genrsa -out alice_key.pem 1024

After that you will need to generate a certificate signing request. This
is then sent to the certificate authority for signing, and returned as
a certificate. 

$ openssl req -new -key alice_key.pem -days 365 -out alice_cert_req.pem

This certificate signing request has to be signed by the certificate authority.

$ openssl x509 -CA ca_cert.pem -CAkey ca_key.pem -CAcreateserial -in alice_cert_req.pem -out alice_cert.pem

After that the certificate is signed, and the request file (alice_cert_req.pem)
can be discarded.
      -CA             specifies the certificate authority's filename
      -CAkey          specifies the associated CA private key
      -CAcreateserial is used the first time the CA is used, to generate
                      a serial file. It shall not be used for the next
                      certificates
      -in             specifies the input certificate signing request
      -out            specifies the output signed certificate
