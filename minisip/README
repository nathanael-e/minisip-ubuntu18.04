README for minisip
==================

Minisip is a SIP user agent. It implements both normal and secured
(SRTP/MIKEY) VoIP calls.

Requirements:
   . libmutil, libmnetutil, libmsip, libmikey
   . libglademm-2.0 (and its dependencies: glib, GTK+, gtkmm, ...) for the GUI

Installation:
   Please refer to the INSTALL file for installation instructions.

   In most cases, this should be enough:
     $ ./configure
     $ make
     # make install

   ./configure --help will give you the available compilation time options.

   For the security features, you will need a X509 certificate (in its pem
   form) and the matching private key. You will find examples in test_cert/
   
   For the experimental video support, have a look at Documentation/video.
